#print is a specialized command used to output values on a screen
# variable syntax for python-->(#)this is a comment
#variable names should not start with special characters(e.g #,$,@,%,*--num=10)
#variable names should not start with a numerical digit. 
#7num, 2num is invalid but num7 or num2 is valid
#a variable name should not have spaces, use underscore or use camel-case method (e.g my age is invalid but my_age,myAge is correct)
#names should not start with capital letters unless they are functional or classes(My_age or MyAge is invalid)
#use relatable names(when dealing with customer use myCustomer)
#use short, simple, relatable names(e.g num instead of number)
#variable names should not be repeated in different forms because python is case sensitive(Name and name are different)
age=26
myName='Sandra'
my_sch = 'Rectory'
print(age)
print(myName)
print(my_sch)
