#django is py frame work used to create web apps
#dj is extremely proceedual, you have to follow step by step
#it follows an MVC model/policy/arrangement
#M-Model, V-View(function), C-Controller
#we use methods to capture data.
#we will have files for view and they will handle requests and models(creat a file called views.py) #view is a function/method
#a model is anything related to a database..in models things are related to databases(file called model.py, database table, one or more tables)a model is equivalent to a db table
#controllers are the URL (will create a file for the uRLs, this sends it to any matching view)they are connected to the requests
#anything that is not registered in the URL the web client will return 404
#any url must have a view
